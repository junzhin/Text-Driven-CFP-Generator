# RetinaLogos: Fine-Grained Synthesis of High-Resolution Retinal Images Through Captions

This document presents the implementation of **RetinaLogos: Fine-Grained Synthesis of High-Resolution Retinal Images Through Captions**, a novel method designed to generate high-resolution Color Fundus Photographs (CFPs) from textual descriptions of retinal conditions. Our method addresses the limitations of existing retinal image synthesis models by providing more detailed and fine-grained control over anatomical structures and disease progression using large-scale text-to-image generation techniques.

## üåü Abstract

The scarcity of high-quality, labeled retinal imaging data presents a significant challenge in ophthalmology. In this work, we introduce **RetinaLogos**, a groundbreaking text-to-image framework that utilizes a large-scale synthetic caption dataset (1.4 million entries) to generate high-resolution retinal images. Our approach combines Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with multimodal text generation, enabling fine-grained semantic control over the generated images. **RetinaLogos** can synthesize retinal images that capture subtle anatomical variations and disease progression, providing valuable insights for early detection and clinical training purposes. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, achieving a 10%-25% improvement in classification tasks such as diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection.
