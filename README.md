# RetinaLogos: Fine-Grained Synthesis of High-Resolution Retinal Images Through Captions

This is the implementation of **[RetinaLogos: Fine-Grained Synthesis of High-Resolution Retinal Images Through Captions](#)**, a method designed to synthesize high-resolution Color Fundus Photographs (CFPs) from textual descriptions of retinal conditions. Our method overcomes the limitations of current retinal image synthesis models by offering more detailed and fine-grained control over anatomical structures and disease progression using large-scale text-to-image generation.

## üåü Abstract

The scarcity of high-quality labelled retinal imaging data poses a significant challenge in ophthalmology. In this work, we introduce RetinaLogos, a novel text-to-image framework that utilizes a large-scale synthetic caption dataset (1.4 million entries) to generate high-resolution retinal images. Our method combines Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and multimodal text generation, enabling fine-grained semantic control over the generated images. RetinaLogos can synthesize retinal images that capture subtle anatomical variations and disease progressions, which can be beneficial for early detection and clinical training purposes. Our approach shows state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, demonstrating a 10%-25% improvement in classification tasks, such as diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection.
